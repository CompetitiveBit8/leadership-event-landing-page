This is my first project with an actual website, a landing page. It is a free template gotten from the internet.

I worked on the following apart from :

	Setting up the virtual environment
	Uploading the project to github for version control
	Reorganising the files to proper API standard
	Rendering the page using the root (/) route in my API.
	Connecting the form table to the database where I got the inputs stored
	I linked the form to a local sqlite databse because postgress on supabase refused to respond
